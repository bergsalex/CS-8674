# GeneWeaver Documentation
GeneWeaver is a web application for the integrated cross-species analysis of functional genomics data from heterogeneous
sources. The application consists of a large database of gene sets curated from multiple public data resources and
curated submissions, along with a suite of analysis tools designed to allow flexible, customized workflows through
web-based interactive analysis or scripted API driven analysis. Gene sets come from multiple widely studied species and
include ontology annotations, brain gene expression atlases, systems genetic study results, gene regulatory information,
pathway databases, drug interaction databases and many other sources. Users can retrieve, store, analyze and share gene
sets through a graded access system. Gene sets and analysis results can be stored, shared and compared privately, among
user defined groups of investigators, and across all users. Analysis tools are based on combinatorics and statistical
methods for comparing, contrasting and classifying gene sets based on their members.

Each “gene set” contains a list of genomic features, free text descriptive content, ontology annotations and gene
association scores. Genomic features are mapped within and across multiple species. Currently, 10 species are supported,
Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, Drosophilia melanogaster, Macaca mulatta, Caenorhabditis
elegans, Saccharomyces cervisiae, Gallus gallus, Canis familiaris. Additional species are added in response to community
request.

GeneWeaver allows users to integrate these diverse functional genomics data across species, tissue and experimental
platform to address questions about the relations among genes and biological functions. Applications include the
prioritization of gene-disease associations from multiple evidence sources, the classification and comparison of
biological functions based on biological substrates, and the identification of similar genes based on function. Cross
species analysis enables the discovery of conserved mechanisms of biological functions, and the discovery of divergent
functions served by conserved biological mechanisms.
