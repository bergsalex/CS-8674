To compare individual user generated gene sets among a collection or to the large database of publicly available sets of
genes, gene sets must first be uploaded and added to analysis projects. Registered users can log in and upload single
gene sets or make use of the Batch Gene Set Upload process. If you have questions about what metadata to enter, see the
General Definitions page and the Standards for Common Gene Set Types.
