# Searching

Our database includes data obtained from numerous external data resources. GeneWeaver allows users to conduct text
searches on metadata and raw data stored in our database. These include searches by permission level, species, curation
tier, gene set information or genes of interest. Occasionally it is useful to search for gene sets anchored on genes or
gene sets of interest based on their overlap with neighboring gene sets. Anchored Biclique of Biomolecular
Associations (ABBA) is a tool that allows you to accomplish this task.
