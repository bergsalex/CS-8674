# External Data Resources

GeneWeaver contains publically available sets of genes annotated to structured vocabularies and ontologies that are
assigned Tier I, or public resource data. Other sets of genes, such as MeSH term-to-gene annotations, are derived from
the processing of public sources and attributed to Tier II. In the case of MeSH, we take advantage of NCBIâ€™s
gene-to-Pubmed and Pubmed-to-mesh files to produce sets of genes annotated through their transitive associations.
