It's going to be a living document. 

Individual documents for each component.

Think about this in a process oriented way. What are the processes? 

Here's the overall framework, here's my vision, here's the modularity, here's the c

one step further down, here's the processes.

Go down and then back up.

At the end, I'll have a design that won't need a tremendous amount of revision.
