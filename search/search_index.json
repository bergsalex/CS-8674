Gene sets come from multiple widely studied species and include ontology annotations, brain gene expression atlases, systems genetic study results, gene regulatory information, pathway databases, drug interaction databases and many other sources. Users can retrieve, store, analyze and share gene sets through a graded access system. Gene sets and analysis results can be stored, shared and compared privately, among user defined groups of investigators, and across all users. Analysis tools are based on combinatorics and statistical methods for comparing, contrasting and classifying gene sets based on their members.</p> <p>Each \u201cgene set\u201d contains a list of genomic features, free text descriptive content, ontology annotations and gene association scores. Genomic features are mapped within and across multiple species. Currently, 10 species are supported, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, Drosophilia melanogaster, Macaca mulatta, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cervisiae, Gallus gallus, Canis familiaris. Additional species are added in response to community request.</p> <p>GeneWeaver allows users to integrate these diverse functional genomics data across species, tissue and experimental platform to address questions about the relations among genes and biological functions. Applications include the prioritization of gene-disease associations from multiple evidence sources, the classification and comparison of biological functions based on biological substrates, and the identification of similar genes based on function. Cross species analysis enables the discovery of conserved mechanisms of biological functions, and the discovery of divergent functions served by conserved biological mechanisms.</p>"},{"location":"Website%20Documentation/01_Getting_Started/","title":"Quick Start Guide","text":""},{"location":"Website%20Documentation/External_Data_Resources/","title":"External Data Resources","text":"<p>GeneWeaver contains publically available sets of genes annotated to structured vocabularies and ontologies that are assigned Tier I, or public resource data.

The Ontological Discovery Environment was conceived of as a tool for the integration of biological functions based on the molecular processes that subserved them. From these data, an empirically derived ontology may one day be inferred. Sounds like a mouthful? We think so, too. Moreover, our acronym, ODE, sounds like \u201cordinary differential equations\u201d, \u201copen development environment\u201d, \u201cOhio Department of Education\u201d, and the airport in Odense, Denmark. Our users have found the system valuable for a wide range of applications in the arena of functional genomic data integration. While the underlying algorithms of The Ontological Discovery Environment can be extended to many contexts, we chose to rename the system \u201cGeneWeaver\u201d to reflect the emphasis on genes and genomes, allowing our users to weave together the many complex relations among processes, pathways and functions implicit in functional genomics experiments.</p>"},{"location":"Website%20Documentation/Frequently_Asked_Questions/#q-how-is-geneweaver-different-from-gene-set-enrichment-or-ontology-over-representation-tools","title":"Q: How is GeneWeaver different from gene set enrichment or ontology over-representation tools?","text":"<p>There are many statistical tools for the analysis of gene set overrepresentation, and it is indeed possible to perform similar analyses using some of the functions in GeneWeaver. However, GeneWeaver\u2019s primary focus and strength is in using gene sets to organize biological functions. GeneWeaver enables highly flexible set-set comparisons of both user submitted and curated gene sets. The suite of combinatorial tools enable large collections of user submitted tools to be compared to each other, and the hierarchical similarity tools enable classification and organization of gene sets based on the genes they contain. This allows discovery of hidden relations among common biological processes, even if those processes have been studied using highly diverse species, analytic methods and approaches. The GeneWeaver tools provide facile data integration and harmonization, and enable user directed integration of new and published results. Major incorporated data from other resources provides a wealth of other sources of contextual information which facilitate interpretation of these discoveries.</p>"},{"location":"Website%20Documentation/Frequently_Asked_Questions/#q-how-do-i-add-my-own-gene-sets-to-geneweaver","title":"Q: How do I add my own gene sets to GeneWeaver?","text":"<p>A: There are step-by-step instructions available in the Uploading Gene Sets section.</p>"},{"location":"Website%20Documentation/Frequently_Asked_Questions/#q-how-do-i-add-open-biological-ontology-annotation-to-my-gene-set","title":"Q: How do I add Open Biological Ontology annotation to my gene set?","text":"<p>A: Browse to your GeneSet and click the \u201cedit\u201d link.
